# Autobots

This program acts as an accountability coach/project coordinator for people working together on projects. It was designed for projects within the DSEG Discord community, but can be used in any Discord community.

The Discord bot that is operated by the program is able to run continuously through a Flask server on Replit that is pinged every five minutes by a free service called UptimeRobot. 

For more information about the bot, as well as guided instructions on how to set up/use it, view this document:
